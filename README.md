## Installation

### 1. Download the file

### 2. Locate your community folder

Verify that you are on the "Latest release" and in "Assets" download the file `nanor-vl3rotax915.zip` by clicking on it.

![Installation Step 2](readme-img/installation-step-2.png)

On your computer, search for the `Community` folder of Flight Simulator 2020. The location of this folder depends on whether you have installed it from the Windows Store, Steam and also if you have changed the folder where the packages are located.

* If you changed the location of packages, it's the simplest because you should find a `Community` sub folder in it.
* For Steam, it should be localted in `C:\Users\[Computer Name]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightDashboard_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Packages\Community`
* For Windows Store `C:\Users\[Computer Name]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Packages\Community`

To access the `AppData\Local` folder directly, type `%appdata%` in the Windows search bar to open the folder quickly, then navigate back to `Local`.

### 3. Extract the mod

When you are sure to be in the proper Community folder, extract the zip file at this folder root. After extracted, you should have a folder named `nanor-vl3rotax915`.

If you are not sure how to do it, download and install 7-zip from [here](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900-x64.exe), copy/paste the zip file to the community folder, right click on it and select "7-Zip => Extract Here" then delete the zip file.

## Edit this mod

After cloning this repo and making modifications, all you have to do is running `.\MSFSLayoutGenerator.exe .\nanor-vl3rotax915\layout.json` to update `layout.json`.
